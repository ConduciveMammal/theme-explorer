## Features

- View details of each theme installed on your Shopify store.
- Access quick links to your theme, such as the Theme Customiser, code editor and theme JSON.
- Quickly preview each theme.
- 100% safe. This extension only works on the currently focused Chrome tab and only when viewing a Shopify store's admin screen so unauthorised users won't be able to see these details.
