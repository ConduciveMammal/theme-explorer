## Install

#### [Chrome extension]()
#### [Firefox add-on]()

## Development

- `npm start` to compile and watch the files for changes.

  To enable the autoreload on chrome:

  1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
  1. Make sure **Developer mode** is on
  1. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the **build/** folder

  Instead, if you want to develop on firefox, check out [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext).

- `npm run build` to just compile the files.
- `npm run bundle` to compile the files and put them in a `.zip`, ready to be published.
